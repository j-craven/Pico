#Pico - JC Fork

Pico is a nice, light-weight CMS. I needed something even more stupidly simple, and being a strong believer that php already is a templating language, I removed the twig dependency and the markdown dependency.

Of course, the existing Pico plugins will not work with this version without some modification. I have already modified one or two, and may add them here in the future.

I may also add back markdown as an optional file format.
